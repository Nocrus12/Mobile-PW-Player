# Brainstorm

- [x] Any topic, language, library, tool
  - Music Player app

- [x] Multiple pages
  - Homepage, playlists, search, settings, login/register page

- [ ] Use of API
  - Unclear. Basically, any anroid app uses Android API 33 or any other specified version
  - If it means the use of REST API, it forces to have cloud backend

- [ ] Profile (login, register, authorize)
  - Profile feature makes sense with cloud backend

As for now this repo contains simple offline music player which basically fetches audio files and plays them, letitng user to control playback
